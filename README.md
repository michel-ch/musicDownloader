# Music Downloader From Excel

Originally this project was made by me to get out of the Deezer ecosystem and stop paying money every month because why not ? üêÄ

Because the deezer API does not allow any creation of Token to access account playlists and bypassing by creating app does not work anymore as well.

The deezer playlist where extracted from [tunemymusic](https://www.tunemymusic.com/) for free by linking Deezer Account.
Exporting the CSV and changing the format to UTF-8 to include all the languages in the correct format and separating the columns of the csv.

After that this script is used to download music from youtube and add metadata of the song in the ```.mp3``` downloaded.
